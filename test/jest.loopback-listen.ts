/**
 * Binds every port-only `listen` of the test suites to the IPv4 loopback address, and makes
 * supertest wait for a listener it starts itself.
 *
 * Layer: test support, loaded through `setupFiles` in `jest.config.ts`, `jest.e2e.config.ts` and
 * `jest.coverage.config.ts`, so every spec that uses supertest runs under it.
 *
 * The reasoning, the patches and their limits are in `test/support/loopback-listen.ts`.
